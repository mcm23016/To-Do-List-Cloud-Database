# Overview

I thought it would be cool to learn about cloud databases. This project turned out very differnet than I originally expected, but I am happy with it, have learned a lot, and realized there is much more to learn. The goal was to have a simple to do list program that was connected to a cloud database so that multiple people can work on the same to-do list or so one person could access it in multiple places. I was originally going to do it in python since I am more comfortable with it. I had a harder time finding materials to help, and realized that I might need more of a front end to interact with a database. I think you could learn using python only, but I swapped over to making a web app and found some useful materials to help me make it. One nice feature that I did not expect was that I was able to save the web app to the home screen of my phone as if it was an app.

# Cloud Database

My database is a Firebase Realtime Database. It is a noSQL database from what I understand and very good for real time applicattions. It only has two branches, a to-do list branch and a completed to-do list branch. Each holds its respective tasks for to be read by the app and then interacted with by the user.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create and edit my code files. I used the Firebase Terminal to initilize and deploy my app. I worked with ChatGpt to better understand the code and help shape the front end into what I wanted it to be.
